# sql_practice
Learning canvas to dump all sql practice that I do on Udemy and Chatgpt queries.
If I don't know something that wasn't mentioned on Udemy, I go to documentation or internet in general to search for the functions and then write about it here. 
Reason for it is I believe SQL is just general queries from possible data or business analysts or stakeholders, so I'm gonna practice it here

Udemy + Chatgpt(similar business queries) + My Solutions + Resources(functions etc.)
